# EDCTN

NIX .NET Development course project done by me.

This project represents a simulation of educational courses learning.
A registered user can enroll for courses and "learn" its materials.
An admin user can do CRUD operations, including creating courses.

Admin account:
Login: admin@nix.dev.com
Password: admin

Using the new knowledge, I created a pet-project following DDD-like architecture (Onion was a destination).
The main language is C#.
Database - MS SQL Server. 
Data access - EF Core (Code-First).
UI - ASP.NET MVC and Razor.

The database and the site itself were deployed to Azure, but change connection string for your own.
